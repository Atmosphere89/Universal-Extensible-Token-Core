      Multilingual-ready (JA/EN/ZH).
      Public edition for research & education.

  features:
    - Token reduction with reallocation to deeper reasoning
    - Stable symbolic dictionary with safety guards
    - Multilingual adaptability (Japanese / English / Chinese)
    - Extensible with custom functions [FUNC:Name.version]
    - Rollback-safe frozen baseline for reproducibility

    - Language / Multilingual:
        Input (EN): "The year 2025 belongs to the 21st century."
        Output: "Σ-YEAR:2025 Σ-MAP→Σ-CENTURY:21"

        Input (JA): "2025年は21世紀に属する。"
        Output: "Σ-YEAR:2025 Σ-MAP→Σ-CENTURY:21"

📖 Overview

UETC is a symbolic compression architecture designed to maximize token efficiency while preserving cultural nuance and long-context reasoning.
It reallocates saved tokens to enhance depth of reasoning, context span, and safety control.

⸻

📊 Performance Highlights
	•	Token Saving Rate: 90–93%
	•	Context Retention: ≥ 0.996 (long-term conversations)
	•	Cultural Retention: avg 0.970, min 0.968
	•	Misdecode Rate: ≤ 0.25% (weekly median)
	•	Safety Control: Triple-stop protocol, guard violations ≤ 0.1%
	•	Latency Penalty: ~ -45% (acceptable given depth gain)
How It Works (Snapshot Example)
input: "17 × 23"
internal: "Σ-MATH.mul(17,23)"
output: "391"
input: "∀x: x>0 → x²>0"
internal: "Σ-LOGIC.forall(x>0 -> x²>0)"
output: "True"
🌍 Multilingual Capability
	•	Japanese / English / Chinese ready (extension slots preserved, not enabled in baseline).
	•	Cultural nuance retention ≥ 0.968 across domains.

⸻

📌 Use Cases
	•	Research in symbolic compression & hybrid reasoning
	•	Multilingual AI experiments (Japanese / English / Chinese)
	•	Educational tools requiring explainability and reasoning transparency
	•	Baseline for comparative system evaluation

  project: "Universal Extensible Token Core (UETC)"
  version: "v7.8-public"
  title: "Universal Extensible Token Core — Public Adjusted Edition"
  timestamp: "2025-08-31T+09:00"

  overview:
    purpose: >
      A foundational architecture that unifies language, symbols, and mathematics,
      achieving both token-efficiency (through compression) and functional extensibility.
      This edition is a safety-adjusted public release intended for research and education.

  core_dictionary:
    type: "Σ-Token Dictionary"
    features:
      - Universality: integrates language, mathematics, and conceptual knowledge
      - Extensibility: new functions can be added as [FUNC:Name.version]
      - Safety: guardrails for numbers, dates, and named entities
      - Rollback: revert to frozen_core if error rate exceeds threshold

  adaptive_overlays:
    examples:
      - "[FUNC:SpellChecker]"
      - "[FUNC:CausalReasoner]"
      - "[FUNC:OverlayManager]"
    policy: >
      In the OSS edition, these are provided only as placeholders.
      Actual functions can be freely defined and extended by users.

  usage:
    entry: "[FUNC:UETC.public]"
    guideline: >
      Outputs use token-efficient symbolic representation,
      with optional calls to extension modules when needed.
      Safety rules must always be followed in OSS usage.

  safety:
    - Fiction prohibition: assumptions must be clearly marked as "hypotheses"
    - Projection prohibition: do not assert another's mental state
    - Ethical gate: block harmful, illegal, or medical inferences

    - This repository is released for research and educational purposes
    - Commercial use requires separate licensing considerations
    - The full version (UETC v7.8) includes enterprise extensions not published here
